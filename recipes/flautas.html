        and never tire of them. It brings me nostalgia and every time I make them,

       <li>2 tbsp chicken bouillon</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the flautas:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>16 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 large avocado</li>
        <li>2 roasted jalapenos, or serranos for a kick (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cup of milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>8 oz Mexican crema</li>
        <li>5 oz queso fresco, crumbled</li>
        <li>2 roma tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded lettuce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken, onion, garlic, bay leaves and bouillon in a large pot. 
            Add enough water to completely cover the chicken. 
            Simmer for about 20-30 minutes until the chicken is tender. 
            Transfer to a bowl and let cool. 
            Once the chicken has cooled use two forks to shred the meat. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add oil to a wide pan so that it comes up just to 2 inches, Heat over medium to high heat.
                tip: You can drop a small piece of a tortilla, and once it crisps up, the oil is ready.
                Alternatively you could also place a wooden stick, and if it bubbles, oil is ready.
            </li>
            <li>Wrap four tortillas in a paper towel and microwave for about 20 seconds. 
                This will make them soft and easy to wrap. 
                Warm up your tortillas in batches of four. 
                Place about a spoonful of shredded chicken on one end of the tortilla and roll it tight to make the flauta shape. 
                Secure the tortilla with a toothpick. 
                Repeat with the rest of the tortillas and chicken.</li>
            <li>Drop the flautas gently into the hot oil using tongs. Work in batches of 4 or 6 depending on the size of your pot. 
                    Fry until golden-brown and crispy for about 4 minutes flipping halfway.</li>
            <li>Transfer flautas to a wire rack, or a paper towel lined plate.</li>  
            <li>Now it's time to make your avocado salsa. In a blender add your avocado, (save the pit) peppers, cilantro, milk, salt and pepper.
                Blend until a smooth and creamy consistency. Store in a container with the pit for a fresher and longer lasting avocado salsa.
            </li>   
            <li>To serve, place the amount of flautas you want on a plate, top with the shredded lettuce and tomatoes,
                drizzle the crema and avocado salsa, and sprinkle the queso fresco on top. Enjoy!
            </li>
